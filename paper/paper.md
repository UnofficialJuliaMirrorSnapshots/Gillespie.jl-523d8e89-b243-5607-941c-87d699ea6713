# Summary

`Gillespie.jl` [@GillespieJL] is a Julia package for stochastic simulation using Gillespie's direct method (sometimes called the Doob-Gillespie algorithm) [@Doob1945;@Gillespie1977], an approach widely used in many fields, including systems biology and epidemiology. It borrows the basic interface (although none of the code) from the R library `GillespieSSA` by Mario Pineda-Krch [@Pineda-Krch2008], although `Gillespie.jl` only implements the standard exact method at present, whereas `GillespieSSA` also includes other methods, such as tau-leaping, *etc.*. `Gillespie.jl` is intended to offer performance on par with hand-coded C code, while maintaining a simple but flexible interface.
